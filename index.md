## Biography

Hi, I am now working at Huawei Tech. I got my PhD degree from Nanjing University, China (2011-2017). My doctor supervisor is Prof. Baowen Xu. I have also been studying at Purdue University (USA) for two years (2014-2016), co-advised by Prof. [Xiangyu Zhang](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/xyzhang/). I got my bachelor degree at Southeast University, China (2007-2011).

## Research Interest

I am mainly working on programming support, bug detection and testing for Python projects. Especially, I am interested in applying technologies such as symbolic execution, probabilistic inference and machine learning to address practical issues involved during the development of Python projects. My another interest is reverse engineering and binary code analysis. I am now also working on this area.
